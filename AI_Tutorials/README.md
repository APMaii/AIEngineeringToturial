# AI Tutorials Guide

This folder contains the core tutorial files for the AI Engineering course.
Use this guide to read the files in the same sequence as the main `README.md`.

## Recommended Reading Sequence

1. [AI_Python_Review.py](AI_Python_Review.py)  
   Python basics: data types, control flow, functions, classes, and iterables.

2. [ADVANCED_Class_Object.py](ADVANCED_Class_Object.py)  
   Advanced OOP concepts: design patterns with classes, `@property`, static/class methods, and encapsulation.

3. [AI_CLI.md](AI_CLI.md)  
   Command line essentials: navigation, file operations, shell usage, and developer workflow basics.

4. [AI_GIT.md](AI_GIT.md)  
   Git and version control workflow: repositories, commits, branches, and collaboration.

5. [AI_NUMPY.py](AI_NUMPY.py)  
   Numerical computing with arrays: indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and vectorized operations.

6. [AI_Matplotlib.ipynb](AI_Matplotlib.ipynb)  
   Data visualization fundamentals: plotting and interpreting results.

7. [AI_Linear_Algebra.py](AI_Linear_Algebra.py)  
   Linear algebra for AI: vectors, matrices, and transformations.

8. [AI_Calculus.py](AI_Calculus.py)  
   Calculus for ML: derivatives, gradients, and optimization intuition.

9. [AI_Numerical.py](AI_Numerical.py)  
   Numerical methods: approximation, stability, and practical computation techniques.

## Additional File

- [AI_LINUX.md](AI_LINUX.md): Linux and DevOps basics for engineering workflows and production readiness.

## How To Study These Files

- Follow the sequence from top to bottom; each file builds on previous concepts.
- Run `.py` files and test examples while reading.
- Take notes on key definitions and formulas (especially math modules).
- Revisit earlier modules if a later topic feels difficult.
